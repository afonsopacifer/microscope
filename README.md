## About the miscroscope

[![microscope view](docs/img/miscroscope-view.png)](http://afonsopacifer.com/demos/microscope/)

**What is it?**

A simple and fast boirleplate that assists the development of Atomic Design Systems.

**What does this do?**

- Create and organize your atoms, molucules, organisms, templates and pages.
- Generate a Atomic Style guide.
- Build your Vanilla CSS UI framework based in your Atomic System.

**How to do?**

- [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) as HTML template engine.
- Preprocessor the CSS with [Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/).
- Build all with [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/).

## Demo
View a [demo](http://afonsopacifer.com/demos/microscope/) :)

## Documentation

See the [Docs page]().

## Tips

**CSS Reset**

In the [/public]() folder, we use the [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) as reset through a [CDN](http://cdnjs.com/libraries/normalize).
Stay attend to it , so that the components are not different in their final application.

**Semantic Grid**

Integrating a Semantic Grid when creating your Organisms and Templates can be a good idea! As the microscope uses Stylus as preprocessor , we suggest the [Flex Grid Framework](http://flexgridframework.com/) for the function :)
